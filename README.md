# Team 2 Project 2 - Movie Review API

## USER STORY

Aa a movie viewer I want a database of movie reviews created by other viewers so that I can read reviews of movies that are more relevant to me than film critic reviews.

## Problems Solved:
- Provide more relevant movie reviews by other users rather than from professional movie critics.
- Provide a searchable database of movie reviews that can be explored any time,with a clean,uncluttered, responsive interface.
